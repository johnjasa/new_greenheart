# Development guidelines

we've already had divergent codebases in the future due to fast-paced project needs and tight timelines
to make this better, we're trying to standardize the way we develop code for GreenHEART in a way that's beneficial for developers, does not slow progress, and is sustainable for the future
this document outlines the guidelines for developing code for GreenHEART
