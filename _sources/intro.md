# Welcome to ODIES

This collection of docs is focused on presenting the next iteration of ODIES, acknowledging where we are now and where we want to be in the future.
Most of these docs are written in a way that we'll be able to reuse them immediately as proper docs in the actual ODIES repo.
For now, to reduce development overhead and encourage rapid iteration, we'll continue to work in this sandbox repo.

Our goal with these doc pages is to communicate ideas that exist in our heads, put them to paper, and provide diagrams where helpful.
These docs are a work in progress; please ask questions about any and all parts presented here.
